## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-03

## [0.8.2] - 2025-11-13

### ✨ Added

- **ASIN field for books**: added `asin` to the `UserBook` model and librarian UI to allow librarians to verify books against ASINs.
- **Developer / Admin tools**: added a Developer Tools screen (visible to the developer account) with user lookup, Pro/Librarian toggles, Pro/Librarians lists, and ASIN management screens.
- **Callable Cloud Functions for admin ops**: added server-side callables (`getUserByEmail`, `setLibrarianStatus`, `setProStatus`, `getProUsers`, `getLibrarians`, `searchUsers`, and `pingAdmin`) to perform privileged operations securely via the Admin SDK.
- **Diagnostics callable & UI**: `pingAdmin` callable and a Diagnostics button in `DeveloperToolsScreen` to validate admin access and show raw diagnostics.

### 🔐 Security & Audit

- **Admin allow-list**: server-side `isAdmin(context)` checks added. The allow-list supports:
  - `ADMIN_UIDS` functions config (deployed),
  - Firestore doc `config/admins` (field `uids`),
  - custom `admin` claim on users, and
  - fallback to the configured developer email.
- **Audit logging**: admin actions are recorded to the `admin_audit` collection (fields: `actorUid`, `actorEmail`, `action`, `targetUid`, `details`, `timestamp`). Several callables write audit entries on successful actions.

### ♻️ Client changes

- **Callable-first client**: `UserManagementService` now prefers calling Cloud Functions for admin operations and falls back to Firestore reads/updates only when necessary.
- **Home dashboard**: moved "Currently Reading" section above Reading Analytics in the home dashboard.

### 📦 Dependencies & Release

- Bumped `cloud_functions` dependency to `^6.0.3` to resolve compatibility with `cloud_firestore`.
- Bumped package version to `0.8.2+2` and created git tag `v0.8.2`.

### 🛠 Notes

- Functions config `admin.uids` was set (developer UID added) and functions were redeployed. The CLI warns that `functions.config()` is deprecated; consider migrating the allow-list to Firestore or the newer dotenv approach before March 2026.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-11-11

### ✨ Added

- Lists UI: Selected-list chips shown in Add/Edit flows and a compact `ListsDropdown` control that opens the full selection screen.
- Lists management screens: `ListsScreen` (create/edit/delete lists) and `ListDetailScreen` (shows books in a list with cover, title, author and remove action).
- Reading status selector in `EditBookModal` (Want to Read / Reading / Finished) and a reusable `StatusBooksScreen` to view books filtered by status.

### 🔧 Changed

- Automatic status date handling: when a book's status transitions to `reading` or `finished`, `dateStarted` and `dateFinished` are set respectively and persisted.
- Home dashboard: stat cards (Want to Read / Reading / Finished) are now navigable and open the corresponding status screens.
- Roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`) updated to mark lists, tests, CI, and status work complete (Nov 11, 2025).

### 🧪 Tests & CI

- Shared test fakes refactored into `test/test_helpers/fakes.dart` and widget tests stabilized: `test/edit_book_modal_test.dart`, `test/list_creation_chip_test.dart`, `test/list_selection_e2e_test.dart` (Nov 11, 2025).
- CI: Added `.github/workflows/flutter_ci.yml` to run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` on PRs.

### 📦 Release housekeeping

- Bumped package version on feature branch to `0.5.3+1` (committed to `feat/list-chips-and-test-fakes`).

### ✅ Notes
