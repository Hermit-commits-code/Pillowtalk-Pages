"2GeLEQAAQBAJ","Popular Romance in Iceland","Sheryl McDonald Werronen","[]","","A late medieval Icelandic romance about the 'maiden-king' of France, Nítída saga generated interest in its day and grew in popularity in post-Reformation Iceland, yet until now it has not received the comprehensive scholarly analysis that it much deserves. Analysing this saga from a variety of perspectives, this book sheds light on the manner in which Nítída saga explores and negotiates the romance genre from an Icelandic perspective, showcasing this exciting saga's strong female characters, worldviews, and long manuscript tradition. Beginning with Nítída saga's manuscript context, including its reception and transformation in early modern Iceland, this study also discusses how Nítída saga was influenced by, and also later influenced, other Icelandic romances. Considering the text as literature, discussion of its unusual depiction of world geography, as well as the various characters and their relationships, provides insights into medieval Icelanders' ideas about themselves and the world they lived in, including questions about Icelandic identity, gender, female solidarity, and the literary genre of romance itself. The book also includes a newly revised reading edition and translation of Nítída saga.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2GeLEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781040792735"

"3ujLn_yIrc4C","Orality and Performance in Early French Romance","Evelyn Birge Vitz","[]","","This book proposes a fundamental revision of the history of early French romance: it argues that oral and performed traditions were far more important in the development of romance than scholars have recognised. Starting with issues of orality and literacy, it is argued that the form in which romances were composed was not the invention of clerics but was, rather, an oral form. The second part of the book looks at performance, and shows that romances such as those of Chretien invited voiced presentation; moreover, they were frequently recited from memory, sung, and acted out in dramatic fashion. Romances can, and should, still be performed today.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=3ujLn_yIrc4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","0859915387"

But when the team's General Manager vocalizes his blatant disapproval of my promotion to Captain, referring to me as an unapproachable lone wolf with no work-life balance, I can't think of a better way to convince him otherwise than pretending to date my outgoing roommate.

"4U61DAAAQBAJ","The Oxford Handbook of the Eighteenth-Century Novel","J. A. Downie","[]","","Although the emergence of the English novel is generally regarded as an eighteenth-century phenomenon, this is the first book to be published professing to cover the 'eighteenth-century English novel' in its entirety. This Handbook surveys the development of the English novel during the 'long' eighteenth century-in other words, from the later seventeenth century right through to the first three decades of the nineteenth century when, with the publication of the novels of Jane Austen and Walter Scott, 'the novel' finally gained critical acceptance and assumed the position of cultural hegemony it enjoyed for over a century. By situating the novels of the period which are still read today against the background of the hundreds published between 1660 and 1830, this Handbook not only covers those 'masters and mistresses' of early prose fiction-such as Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, Burney, Scott and Austen-who are still acknowledged to be seminal figures in the emergence and development of the English novel, but also the significant number of recently-rediscovered novelists who were popular in their own day. At the same time, its comprehensive coverage of cultural contexts not considered by any existing study, but which are central to the emergence of the novel, such as the book trade and the mechanics of book production, copyright and censorship, the growth of the reading public, the economics of culture both in London and in the provinces, and the re-printing of popular fiction after 1774, offers unique insight into the making of the English novel.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=4U61DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780191651069"

But when a blazing river halts their steam train in the middle of nowhere, the veteran turned detective starts to wish he had stayed in New York. With a homicidal Stanny hot on their trail—maybe poisoning Stanny's man was a bad idea—Donovan needs to get Phoebe out of Juniper Junction fast. Even if that means taking a few jobs for some quick cash. He doesn't expect to find a mining company on the brink of war with a union, or bloodthirsty strike-breakers itching to use a steam tank and other weapons he hasn't seen since the War of Southern Secession. Or that underneath it all lies something much darker—an unspeakably diabolical conspiracy… For more Donovan Schist mysteries, check out Cruel Numbers. 87,000 words","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=5WbkDhSFV0gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781426895081"

"6fOAEQAAQBAJ","Still Reading Romance","Josefine Smith, Kathleen W. Taylor Kollman","[]","","In a world that commodifies feminism, is adapting romance novels for small and big screen projects, and the Romance Writers Association is evolving to a more inclusive representative group, it is imperative for researchers to reevaluate the cultural assumptions and gender norming work happening in the romance genre. It is time to question the cultural capital of traditional archetypes, explore the experience of romance readers, and question how romance and cultural studies researchers create quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research. This work centers around a data set collected with a revised version of Janice Radway’s Reading the Romance survey that will be shared with all the authors of this anthology. By having access to this pool, authors will have the opportunity to explore different elements of reader experience and cultural norms in romance fiction, and potentially reflect on changes since Janice Radway’s seminal work. The norms and negotiations readers experience while consuming romance is especially interesting as romancelandia becomes a more mainstream part of popular culture with the popularity of Bridgerton and romance series like Ice Planet Barbarians exploding on BookTok. No other book in romance or popular culture studies identifies a data set as the connecting element, and to do so creates an exciting opportunity to create a more inclusive study of popular romance, offer truly interdisciplinary research on the question of how readers read romance, and generate diverse areas of future scholarship. This edited volume explores multiple issues in romance fiction, based on survey data from real romance readers. An updated version of Janice Radway’s influential survey looking at romance readers in the early 1980s, this time scholars explore romance readers’ habits and attitudes in the twenty-first century. Each contributor in this volume uses the same survey data to make unique statements about gender, intersectionality, popular fiction, and popular culture. By using a common data set but approaching it from different perspectives, this unique volume is able to apply multiple methodologies to the same subject.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=6fOAEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9798881863791"

"7EVnEQAAQBAJ","Dissident Voices","Mike Wayne","[]","","‘Wayne’s study offers an impressive range of readings and critical methodologies within a collection of exceptional coherence... Dissident Voices is consistently compulsive reading and a must for all students and specialists in the field of recent and contemporary television culture.’ Professor Madeleine MacMurraugh-Kavanagh, University of Reading Two decades of institutional and structural changes in television broadcasting have both informed and reflected profound shifts in British culture. How have programme makers themselves approached the tensions and anxieties of the last twenty years? Dissident Voices examines the ways in which certain forms and genres have registered a period of cultural upheaval and to what extent they have developed a more reflexive and a more critical television culture. This collection covers a broad range of issues including class, gender and sexuality, the monarchy, identity and nationhood. It examines their representation in a variety of dramas and genres, including police procedurals, documentaries, game shows, sitcoms and satire. The contributors challenge the notion of television as a bland purveyor of the status quo, presenting it as a complex and potentially subversive medium. Television culture is portrayed here as still resistant to the total control of either markets or ideologies. In an age of political consensus, it is an important and popular site where anxiety about and dissent from current social trends frequently surface.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=7EVnEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781849645126"

"8g_l0AEACAAJ","Break the Ice","Jes Tongio","[""Fiction""]","","He's the cocky celebrity goalie who wants a fresh start. She's the ruthless assistant coach who wants him off her team. Working together to win a championship will be no easy score. Why would star goaltender Daniel Evans join the struggling Toronto Towers? Assistant coach Lauryn Jackson is skeptical of his motives and overrated skillset. Daniel just wants to get on the good side of Lauryn's skirt-suit and stilettos, but she doesn't have time for his smug, perfectly scruffy face. She's determined to lead the Towers to victory in her own way, but the men in power have different plans. Lauryn soon realizes she could use Daniel's influence to her advantage. As the Towers chase an elusive championship title, the tension and attraction build between Daniel and Lauryn. Their undeniable connection forces them to confront their deepest fears and desires. Break the Ice is a pro-hockey contemporary romance, written by a former sports journalist. The banter is as sharp as skates. The steamy scenes are more intense than power plays. And the laughs hit like unexpected slap shots. This heartwarming, long-form novel is the first book in the Game Over series, and can be read as a standalone. What makes this hockey romance unique? - The female protagonist is a member of the hockey team - not a figure skater, a public relations manager, or a player's sister. Break the Ice's female lead is a coach! - In this universe, the NHL doesn't exist. Instead, the fictional North American Hockey League is the pinnacle of pro-hockey, and is more progressive about employing women and people of colour. - It's not just about love and dating. It's about how to land your dream job. It's about redefining what family means. It's about how to manage anxiety. Not a hockey fan? Not a problem! This novel includes footnotes to empower readers with relevant hockey knowledge!

"8n2sDgAAQBAJ","Queering Contemporary Asian American Art","Laura Kina, Jan Christian Bernabe","[]","","Queering Contemporary Asian American Art takes Asian American differences as its point of departure, and brings together artists and scholars to challenge normative assumptions, essentialisms, and methodologies within Asian American art and visual culture. Taken together, these nine original artist interviews, cutting-edge visual artworks, and seven critical essays explore contemporary currents and experiences within Asian American art, including the multiple axes of race and identity, queer bodies and forms, kinship and affect, and digital identities and performances. Using the verb and critical lens of “queering” to capture transgressive cultural, social, and political engagement and practice, the contributors to this volume explore the connection points in Asian American experience and cultural production of surveillance states, decolonization and diaspora, transnational adoption, and transgender bodies and forms, as well as heteronormative respectability, the military, and war. The interdisciplinary and theoretically informed frameworks in the volume engage readers to understand global and historical processes through contemporary Asian American artistic production.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=8n2sDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780295741369"

Ryu Mori has had a stellar season as goalie for the Atlanta Venom. So when he’s called into management’s office, he’s expecting to hear he’s the new starting goalie for the team, not that some new guy—an incredibly hot, annoyingly bratty rookie—is here to compete for his spot. Not everyone gets to play in the best league in the world. Emmitt Armstrong knows that, and he’s not about to waste the opportunity after grinding his way from the bottom to the top. If the Venom are looking for a meek, mild-mannered pushover, they’ve got the wrong guy. Ryu doesn’t want to admit the other goalie’s smart mouth turns him on.

"9R-yDwAAQBAJ","Football in Fiction","Lee McGowan","[]","","Football in Fiction represents the most comprehensive historical mapping and analysis of novels related to association football (soccer). It offers a theoretically informed field guide, a scholarly cartography of football fiction’s uncertain – and until now – only partially explored terrain. Combining an extensive search for texts with up-to-date academic research, journals, surveys, catalogues, and reviews the book demonstrates a topographic perspective of the field – one that captures and establishes its breadth, depth, and distinctive identity. The book uses and adapts two distinct reading models of abstraction, in conjunction with closer textual analyses. Together they assist in realising a set of demonstrable conventions, outline a taxonomy of fictive types, establish the genre’s current state of play, and advance the football novel as a form with its own literary history and traditions. This book is a valuable resource for those studying and researching in the areas of the social and cultural aspects of football, sports fiction, sports writing, creative writing, and literary and genre studies. Furthermore, related industry professionals will find this a fascinating read, particularly football writers, fans of the sport, and those interested in sports history and cultural phenomena.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=9R-yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781000693140"

"Ah4bi8EHxFgC","Conquering the Reign of Femeny","Angela Jane Weisl","[]","","Close study of Chaucer's most important works shows how he used gender issues to extend the range of romance. The paradox of romance as a genre is that it contains multiple possibilities, yet remains profoundly constrained by its own terms and conventions. Through a close reading of several of Chaucer's most important works, Dr Weisl examines Chaucer's use of gender issues to explore and challenge this genre. She argues that Chaucer's complex treatment of the romance, following both continental and Middle English traditions, experiments with and tests romance conventions. Each chapter looks indetail at one or more of Chaucer's works, examining their different approaches to the problems of gender, and showing how this is closely connected with genre. Subjects addressed include the feminised private spaces in Troilus and Criseydewhich protect Criseyde, but are inevitably penetrated by male power; the masculine imperatives of the epic which challenge the limits of the feminised romance in the Knight'sTale(and the speech of its heroine Emelye, who questions the assumptions of the genre itself); Canacee in the Squire's Tale, who rejects the stereotyped role of the heroine, and the romance world in the Tale of SirThopas, without a heroine at all.Dr ANGELA JANE WEISLis visiting assistant professor of English and Women's Studies at Wittenberg University, Ohio.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ah4bi8EHxFgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","0859914607"

"CzZwEAAAQBAJ","Love and Organization","Michael Pirson","[]","","Organizations are not human, but they are made up of people. Examining the organization, functioning, growing and developing and moving together as one unit, the well-being and success of that organization depends on the well-being of people that make it up. Love, in its various forms, is the energy that motivates and fuels creativity, care, innovation, progress and well-being. Traditionally, organizational structures have been set up to support compliance and command and control, which often discourages love and creates policies against love at the workplace. The result has been reduced growth, productivity and retention of businesses as well as reduced well-being for employees. This reduced connectivity between individuals has also, at a higher level, adversely affected society. Without love, people are working and performing with reduced energy, and at reduced capacity. While prior research has been focused on love at the workplace from the viewpoint of psychologists, this book explores the impact of love within organizational contexts from various viewpoints including management, psychology, and philosophy. It explores love in the organizational context by looking at how it affects meaning, purpose, well-being, motivation, faith, care, spiritual development and how the identity and well-being of each person in the organization positively affects retention and the growth and success of that organization. It will be of interest to researchers, academics, and advanced students in the fields of organizational studies, leadership, and management.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=CzZwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781000603958"

The problem is when I think of putting myself first, I think of my son's biological father, Thatcher Patterson. The man that wanted nothing to do with me when he found out I was pregnant. When he left me, he took my heart with him and I've never gotten it back. Suddenly my son and I are forced to live with Thatcher indefinitely and it's difficult to remember all the reasons why I don't trust him.

"GgHlFxwLqvwC","Consuming Fantasies","Lise Sanders","[]","","""In Consuming Fantasies: Labor, Leisure, and the London Shopgirl, 1880-1920, Lise Shapiro Sanders examines the cultural significance of the shopgirl - both historical figure and fictional heroine - from the end of Queen Victoria's reign through the First World War. As the author reveals, the shopgirl embodied the fantasies associated with a growing consumer culture: romantic adventure, upward mobility, and the acquisition of material goods. Reading novels such as George Gissing's The Odd Women and W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage as well as short stories, musical comedies, and films, Sanders argues that the London shopgirl appeared in the midst of controversies over sexual morality and the pleasures and dangers of London itself. Sanders explores the shopgirl's centrality to modern conceptions of fantasy, desire, and everyday life for working women and argues for her as a key figure in cultural and social histories of the period. This study will appeal to scholars, students, and enthusiasts of Victorian and Edwardian life and literature.""--BOOK JACKET.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=GgHlFxwLqvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780814210178"

Raised in isolation on the magic-shrouded Isle of the Moon, five girls became five sisters. Now women, they are ready to claim their places in the world—and perhaps change it forever . . . FLAME AND FORTUNE Sorcha knew the mission was dangerous. Leaving the safe grounds of her brother’s kingdom and parlaying with the elves across their border . . . well, treachery seemed at least as likely as true peace.

He saw the battle from the trees, saw the soldier attacking against incredible odds to save a comrade—and then saw the valiant fighter revealed as Princess Sorcha of Norveshka. He can’t tell if he wants to kidnap her or kiss her. But despite Sorcha’s stubbornness, his inconvenient honor, and a rebellion on the cusp of full war, something burns between them that neither can let go . . . “Sparks' crafting of distinct kingdoms and fantasy races is the strongest part of the series…An adventurous fantasy romp.” —Kirkus Reviews “Satisfying chemistry, a playful sense of adventure, and the threat of more danger to come keep the pages turning.

In this collection, scholars and authors explore the imaginative geography of a wide range of places, from those of Indigenous myth to the fantasy worlds of Middle-earth, Earthsea, or Pacificus, from the semi-fantastic Wild Wood to real-world places like Canada’s North, Chicago’s World Fair, or the modern urban garden. What happens to young protagonists who explore new worlds, whether fantastic or realistic? What happens when Old World and New World myths collide? How do Indigenous myth and sense of place figure in books for the young? How do environmental or post-colonial concerns, history, memory, or even the unconscious affect an author's creation of place? How are steampunk and science fiction mythically re-enchanting for children? Imaginative geography means imaged earth writing: it creates what readers see when they enter the world of fiction.

As a literary agent, she’s listened to hundreds of pitches and read through tens of thousands of query letters and manuscript submissions. Being both a published author and a literary agent gives her a unique perspective on publishing. She knows what it’s like to be the writer whose only desire is to sell a novel, and she knows what it’s like to have to crush someone’s hopes with a rejection letter. It wasn’t until she started sending out those rejection letters that she began to have a better understanding of why so many writers receive them. What she’s come to realize is that most manuscripts are rejected by agents and editors for one or more of ten basic reasons. Writers have control over some of these reasons but not all of them.

"KtzBDwAAQBAJ","The Routledge History of Witchcraft","Johannes Dillinger","[]","","The Routledge History of Witchcraft is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary study of the belief in witches from antiquity to the present day, providing both an introduction to the subject of witchcraft and an overview of the on-going debates. This extensive collection covers the entire breadth of the history of witchcraft, from the witches of Ancient Greece and medieval demonology through to the victims of the witch hunts, and onwards to children’s books, horror films, and modern pagans. Drawing on the knowledge and expertise of an international team of authors, the book examines differing concepts of witchcraft that still exist in society and explains their historical, literary, religious, and anthropological origin and development, including the reflections and adaptions of this belief in art and popular culture. The volume is divided into four chronological parts, beginning with Antiquity and the Middle Ages in Part One, Early Modern witch hunts in Part Two, modern concepts of witchcraft in Part Three, and ending with an examination of witchcraft and the arts in Part Four. Each chapter offers a glimpse of a different version of the witch, introducing the reader to the diversity of witches that have existed in different contexts throughout history. Exploring a wealth of texts and case studies and offering a broad geographical scope for examining this fascinating subject, The Routledge History of Witchcraft is essential reading for students and academics interested in the history of witchcraft.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=KtzBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781000765748"

Many erotic stories focus on the thrill of first contact, but Take This Man is thrillingly different, taking a close look at how much sexier an encounter can be when the two men involved have been together for long enough to make a commitment to each other. Formalized or not, the fact remains that knowing what turns your partner on — and vice versa — makes encounters even hotter, especially when the erotic encounter is an expression of an emotional bond.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=KwJuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","9781627781008"

The study investigates the cultural production of the visual iconography of popular pleasure grounds from the eighteenth century pleasure garden to the contemporary theme park. Deborah Philips identifies the literary genres, including fairy tale, gothic horror, Egyptiana and the Western which are common to carnival sites, tracing their historical transition across a range of media to become familiar icons of popular culture.Though the bricolage of narratives and imagery found in the contemporary leisure zone has been read by many as emblematic of postmodern culture, the author argues that the clash of genres and stories is less a consequence of postmodern pastiche than it is the result of a history and popular tradition of conventionalised iconography.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=N8_rX1e70eAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781849666671"

However, the literary category that later emerged bore less resemblance to young adult fiction and instead became a sub-genre of another major popular genre: romance. This Element uses new adult fiction as a case study to explore how genres develop in the twenty-first-century literary marketplace. It traces new adult's evolution through three key stages in order to demonstrate the fluidity that characterises contemporary genres. It argues for greater consideration of paratextual factors in studies of genre. Using a genre worlds approach, it contends that in order to productively examine genre, we must consider industrial and social factors as well as texts.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=O_JLEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781108902489"

He welcomes a different one to his bed each night, or at least he had until five months ago when he became alpha.

Promised at birth to a male she has never met, Maya has left her pride behind to go to the tiger alpha who is to be her mate, but she can’t leave without saying goodbye to her older brother, Talon. A stop in London at Underworld to see him one last time turns out far different, and far more dangerous, than how she had imagined it when she sets eyes on an alluring crimson-haired stranger who stirs new, unbidden feelings in her, desires that rouse her fiercest and most frightening instincts and demand she stake a claim on him—her fated mate.

"PXm-EAAAQBAJ","Transformation of Love","Elif Güvendi Yalçın","[]","","Romances date back to the creation of stories. Although the definition of the genre has changed in time from the Ancient Greeks to the Bildungsromans,to the 19th century and today’s courtship novels, both scholarship and widely-held attitudes towards romance has remained fixedly and prioritized only the universality, unoriginality, and continuity of romance fiction instead of its sociocultural effect of promoting positive ideals like female empowerment. The portrayal of women in social roles has been in a state of constant change including their relationship with and relation to men. This book explores only medieval historical romance fictions and their changes through the course of the time. I examine three medieval romances’ content—Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe (1920), Kathleen Woodowiss’ The Wolf and the Dove (1974), and Amanda Quick’s Mystique (1995)-- written in different time periods based on content analysis using Anthony Giddens’s (1992) theories of intimacy. In addition, it will address romance novels’ views about sex, gender and love roles.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=PXm-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9786258341744"

"QKAzEQAAQBAJ","John Cowper Powys and the Afterlife of Romanticism","Kim Wheatley","[]","","This study bridges the chronological divide between the Romantic era and the first six decades of the 20th century, interpreting John Cowper Powys (1872–1963) as a major, under-recognized contributor to the cultural transmission of Romanticism. Kim Wheatley's John Cowper Powys and the Afterlife of Romanticism uncovers the surprising extent to which this multi-faceted Modernist-era author reworked key concerns of the Romantic poets. Wheatley shows how Powys's prose rewritings of Romantic poetry contribute to the story of the posthumous life of Romanticism, especially its environmental legacy. In particular, the book expands our understanding of the early 20th-century reception of William Wordsworth and John Keats. Wheatley argues that Powys anticipates and presciently interrogates recent revisionary critical approaches to the Romantics, primarily materialist eco-critical approaches, and therefore invites a fresh environmentalist criticism open to the transcendental and the supernatural. Chapters range across Powys's extensive oeuvre, investigating his treatment of Wordsworth and Keats in his works of fiction, autobiographical writings, popular philosophical books, and essays of literary appreciation, including his Autobiography (1934), his four major Wessex novels – Wolf Solent (1929), A Glastonbury Romance (1932), Weymouth Sands (1934), and Maiden Castle (1936) – and his later Welsh historical novels Owen Glendower (1941) and Porius (1951). Wheatley demonstrates how Powys uniquely combines sense-based nature-worship, the leveling of animate and inanimate, and care for disabled human beings, along with mystical and magical themes, into an all-encompassing ecological vision more capacious than any imagined by the Romantics themselves.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=QKAzEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9798765119440"

"SSf-CQAAQBAJ","Sex and the Office","Kim Elsesser","[]","","Women are not to blame for their lack of advancement at work. Failure to lean in and greater responsibility for childcare don’t fully explain why women are not reaching the top levels of many corporations. The truth is, many senior male executives are reluctant to have a one-on-one meeting with a junior woman at work. They’re afraid that an offhand remark will be misinterpreted as sexual harassment or that their friendliness will be mistaken for romantic interest. As a result, many male executives stick with other men, especially when it comes to dinners, drinks, late-night meetings, or business trips. When it’s time for promotions or pay raises, these same executives are more likely to show preference to the employees with whom they feel most comfortable—other men. In Sex and the Office, Kim Elsesser delves into how issues as varied as workplace romance, spousal jealousy, organizational sexual harassment policies, and communication differences create barriers between the sexes at work. Since senior management is still largely dominated by men, these barriers—which Elsesser labels “the sex partition”—often leave female employees without the influential friends and mentors critical for career success. Fortunately, all hope is not lost. Elsesser offers practical advice on how to break down the sex partition and reveals the best strategies for networking with the opposite sex. Sex and the Office is sure to spark new dialogue on the sources of the gender gap as well as its solutions.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=SSf-CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781630761219"

Examining how the cut-and-thrust swashbucklers of the 1930s gave way to female-orientated romances, Helen Hughes takes a comprehensive look at how romance authors have dealt with the turbulent question of female independence, and how traditional attitudes towards love, marriage and women's sexuality have been approached in more recent texts. Hughes also charts the ways in which the marketing of romance has developed, with the eventual explosion of the mass market and the blockbusting family sagas of the eighties. The Historical Romance unravels the formulaic and mythical nature of historical romance to provide a fascinating study of this highly popular genre.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=UfeJAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781134932016"

"XrWFGSUU93AC","Gender, Interpretation, and Political Rule in Sidney's Arcadia","Kathryn DeZur","[]","","Gender, Interpretation, and Political Rule in Sidney’s Arcadia studies cultural ideologies regarding gender and monarchy in early modern England by examining transformations of a single text, Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia, in their historical contexts. It reveals changing tensions in the ideological struggles over queenship, especially with respect to cultural debates focused on anxieties about gendered reception and interpretation of persuasive rhetoric. The cultural shift between about 1550 and 1650 regarding gendered interpretation and political rule—a shift that was by no means complete or homogenous—reflects the changing position of women and their relationship to language within early modern domestic and political ideological discourses. The book begins by investigating primary cultural, political, and historical sources in order to provide a cultural scaffolding helpful to the interpretation of Sidney’s enormously popular work. These sources include conduct manuals, gynecocratic debates, paintings, poems, diaries, pamphlets, and letters. Gender, Interpretation, and Political Rule then considers the initial version of the Arcadia (the Old Arcadia) Sidney authored and argues that Sidney’s involvement in the marriage debate regarding the Duke of Anjou’s courtship of Elizabeth I in the late 1570s shaped his representations of female characters and their questionable ability to interpret persuasive rhetoric. Next, the book turns to Sidney’s expanded and revised version (the New Arcadia), authorized and published by his sister the Countess of Pembroke Mary Sidney Herbert. The New Arcadia ultimately provides a more positive representation of women readers and rulers and reveals a shift in cultural understandings of women’s relationship to the persuasive rhetoric that both describes and enacts political power and authority. The penultimate chapter examines paradigms of active reading and their political consequences in Lady Mary Wroth’s The Countess of Montgomery’s Urania that demonstrate a need for well-balanced identification with characters. Finally, this book focuses on a little-studied seventeenth-century continuation of Sidney’s work by a young woman, Anna Weamys, who asserts her authority as an interpreter of Sidney’s Arcadia and in the process creates a political commentary about the legitimacy of female authority and influence just after the English Civil War.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=XrWFGSUU93AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781611494181"

"YV35DwAAQBAJ","The Consummate Virgin","Jodi McAlister","[]","","This book is a study of female virginity loss and its representations in popular Anglophone literatures. It explores dominant cultural narratives around what makes a “good” female virginity loss experience by examining two key forms of popular literature: autobiographical virginity loss stories and popular romance fiction. In particular, this book focuses on how female sexual desire and romantic love have become entangled in the contemporary cultural imagination, leading to the emergence of a dominant paradigm which dictates that for women, sexual desire and love are and should be intrinsically linked together: something which has greatly affected cultural scripts for virginity loss. This book examines the ways in which this paradigm has been negotiated, upheld, subverted, and resisted in depictions of virginity loss in popular literatures, unpacking the romanticisation of the idea of “the right one” and “the right time”.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=YV35DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9783030550042"

The tales plunder a wide range of earlier literature from Homer to the French romances - as in the tale of the wandering hero Arrow-Odd, which combines several older legends, or Egil and Asmund, where the story of Odysseus and the Cyclops is skilfully adapted into a traditional Norse legend.

"bwIwEQAAQBAJ","Old Films, Young Eyes","Simone O. Elias","[]","","Why would a modern teenager find classic films enthralling? This book presents an eye-opening tour of how old movies foreshadowed, influenced--and continue to shape--popular culture in many surprising ways. From foreseeing today's image-dominated social media landscape to ushering rock music into the mainstream, and sparking elements of the #MeToo movement, classic movies remain relevant and inspiring. Despite prevailing attitudes that old films are outdated, many dramatically broke boundaries around racism and antisemitism. They predicted current trends in divorce and sexual relations. They helped shape current icons like Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga, as well as foreshadowing more sobering events such as the Covid-19 pandemic. A Gen Z-age cultural critic, author Simone O. Elias presents an insider's perspective on the socio-cultural impact of classic Hollywood films on a modern generation.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=bwIwEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781476696591"

"eN67zgEACAAJ","Across The North Sea","Sofia Hahn","[]","","When the Frankish sisters Ishild and Odilia are stolen away to the North by savage Norsemen, they must each adapt to survive in such a brutish, unforgiving land, so far from home. Odilia's Story: After the attack on her home, Frankish noblewoman Odilia is taken hostage by a Viking warrior with unknown motivations. She has never seen a Viking before, let alone one from the African continent; with his umber-colored skin and black, textured locs, he stands apart from the other Northerners- in more ways than just appearance. When Odilia is saved from becoming the concubine of another Norseman, and dangerous forces require her to hunker down in hiding at Svendsholm, the dark Viking swears his fealty to her. However, having suffered the tragedy of losing his family once before, Torsten has no desire to ever marry; as Odilia withers from the weight of her increasingly unrequited love for her savior, she wonders if she can possibly show Torsten that taking a chance on love- even at the risk of a lifetime of hardship- is worth everything. Ishild's Story: During her attempt to flee from the raid on her home, the eldest daughter of Adalbehrt of the Franks stumbles across a wounded Norseman; against her better judgement, Ishild saves his life- a mistake that leads to her ultimate capture and subsequent imprisonment in the North. She soon becomes the promised bride of the chieftain, forcing her to remain locked away and isolated from the rest of the village. Having been married once before, to a monster of a man, Ishild would rather die than become a bride again. That is, until a series of odd circumstances lead her to the very same Viking whose life she had saved; willing to repay his debt to his brother's captive, Brandr promises to teach Ishild to fight, so that she may fight her captors and win her freedom. They hold their clandestine meetings beneath the chieftain's own nose, both aware that he could exile them or worse, should they be discovered. When she learns of Brandr's terrible secret, however, Ishild must choose between her romantic feelings for the dishonorable Viking, or her plan to save herself- before it is too late for either of them. Reviews for ""Across the North Sea"" ""If you love enemies to lovers, villain romance, and forced proximity then you might need to read this one."" -Goodreads reviewer ""These are not your typical ""r*pe and pillage"" Vikings, they show a great deal of hesitation, guilt and repentance when it comes to the mistreatment of women. A nice Viking love story for those who might enjoy a Viking romance without full on nonconsensual sex."" -Goodreads reviewer ""This is my first read by Sofia Hahn but it won't be the last. Loved the language and customs of the Viking world thrown in."" -Goodreads reviewer ""Absolutely loved this story. It was my first Viking romance and I was consistently engaged the whole time. Well written and can't wait for more by this author."" -Booksprout reviewer ""Overall the story has made me more interested in the era, and I'll be looking out for future historical romances by Sofia Hahn. I recommend this book to all Viking fans and those seeking historical novels in general."" -Goodreads reviewer Author's Notes *Told in alternating POVs, both sisters' stories are intertwined in a duet throughout the novel; while they are intended to be read straight through and all at once, they can also be read separately by skipping chapters. Ishild's Story is told in the even-numbered chapters, while Odilia's Story has all of the odd-numbered chapters. **Readers take note: This book contains violence, death, blood, mature scenes, and attempted, on-page assault (including by one of the mains). More or less what you would expect from a Viking/historical romance.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=eN67zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","9798460977246"

"fFz8EAAAQBAJ","The Oxford History of the Novel in English","Cyrus R. K. Patell, Deborah Lindsay Williams","[]","","The Oxford History of the Novel in English is a twelve-volume series presenting a comprehensive, global, and up-to-date history of English-language prose fiction, written by a large, international team of scholars. The series is concerned with novels as a whole, not just the 'literary' novel, and each volume includes chapters on the processes of production, distribution, and reception, and on popular fiction and the fictional sub-genres, as well as outlining the work of major novelists, movements, and tendencies. This book offers an account of US fiction during a period demarcated by two traumatic moments: the eve of the entry of the United States into the Second World War and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aftermath of the Second World War was arguably the high point of US nationalism, but in the years that followed, US writers would increasingly explore the possibility that US democracy was a failure, both at home and abroad. For so many of the writers whose work this volume explores, the idea of ""nation"" became suspect as did the idea of ""national literature"" as the foundation for US writing. Looking at post-1940s writing, the literary historian might well chart a movement within literary cultures away from nationalism and toward what we would call ""cosmopolitanism,"" a perspective that fosters conversations between the occupants of different cultural spaces and that regards difference as an opportunity to be embraced rather than a problem to be solved. During this period, the novel has had significant competition for the US public's attention from other forms of narrative and media: film, television, comic books, videogames, and the internet and the various forms of social media that it spawned. If, however, the novel becomes a ""residual"" form during this period, it is by no means archaic. The novel has been reinvigorated over the past eighty years by its encounters with both emergent forms (such as film, television, comic books, and digital media) and the emergent voices typically associated with multiculturalism in the United States.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=fFz8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780192659071"

"fhFREAAAQBAJ","Victorian Literature and Finance","Francis O'Gorman","[]","","Victorian Britain offered to the globe an economic structure of unique complexity. The trading nation, at the heart of a great empire, developed the practices of advanced capitalism - currency, banking, investment, money markets, business practices and theory, intellectual property legislation - from which the financial systems of the contemporary world emerged. Cultural forms in Victorian Britain transacted with high capitalism in a variety of ways but literary critics interested in economics have traditionally been preoccupied either with writers' hostility to industrial capitalism in terms of its shaping of class, or with the development of consumerism. Victorian Literature and Finance is the first extended study to take seriously the relationships between literary forms and those more complex discourses of Victorian high finance. These essays move beyond the examination of literature that was merely impatient with the perceived consequences of capitalism to analyse creative relationships between culture and economic structures. Considering such topics as the nature of currency, women and the culture of investment, the profits of a modern media age, the dramatization of risk on the Victorian stage, the practice of realism in relation to business theory, the culture of speculation at the end of the century, and arguments about the uncomfortable relationship between literary and financial capital, Victorian Literature and Finance sets new terms for understanding and theorizing the relationship between high finance and literary writing in the nineteenth century.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=fhFREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780191536007"

This new biographical work fills considerable gaps in Anne Bonny’s life beyond her mythology to rescue an actual person for posterity. After turning her back on everything she knew growing up in South Carolina to find a sense of personal freedom, Anne Bonny sailed the Caribbean’s pristine waters during the Golden Age of Piracy in the early eighteenth century. Few accurate records exist about these law-breakers, whose lifestyles called for hanging. Fortunately, Anne Bonny was a notable exception to the rule, as she was caught off the Jamaican coast and tried by a court of law, whose records have fortunately survived. So, who was the real Anne Bonny? A heartless prostitute, a bloodthirsty psychopathic, or a compassionate woman of faith and courage? Such a fundamental question has not been adequately answered by historians for 300 years. It is now time to take a fresh look at the life of Anne Bonny to present a corrective view into not only her story but also the seldom explored, but incredibly rich, field of women’s history. The Anne Bonny mythology is today popularly told in Starz channel’s Black Sails and the video game Assassin's Creed.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=i50sDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781627310628"

"iUciEAAAQBAJ","Indian Middle Ages","Gurdeep Khullar","[""Fiction""]","","Time magazine stated that Game of Thrones is the most popular show in the world. It took the viewers to a remote, unknown past through an atmosphere of a dream world which comes into being with the help of the creation of an illusion. The strange, supernatural, and extraordinary world of beauty, fear, awe, mystery, talisman, and gallantry is created. Since these events occur in a centuries-old world far away from modern times, the viewers can enjoy them and believe that once upon a time they really may have happened.One hundred years ago, on the other side of the globe, some historical novelists and historical romancers in India created similar artworks in the Hindi language. These works contain almost exactly the same thematic characteristics by describing the life and activities of extremely voluptuous ""nawabs"" and prostitutes. They depicted their luxurious and opulent lifestyle, full of vulgar sex, free desires, dreams, and yearnings along with talismans to create a unique environment and the feelings of thrill and awe.This book is a humble effort to bring a sociological and philosophical perspective to these literary creations. It provides a lively and vibrant picture of various social and cultural traditions, customs, and superstitions of medieval Indian society. A glossary of Hindi and Sanskrit words is provided for the convenience of Western readers.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=iUciEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781643349138"

"ikMiEAAAQBAJ","Double Talk","Wayne Koestenbaum","[]","","Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer on hysteria, J.A. Symonds and Havelock Ellis on sexuality, a novel by Ford Madox Ford and Joseph Conrad, The Waste Land of T.S. Eliot (and Ezra Pound), even the Lyrical Ballads of Wordsworth and Coleridge: men making books together. Wayne Koestenbaum's startling interpretation of literary collaboration focuses on homosexual desire: men write together, he argues, in order either to express or to evade homosexual feelings. Their writing becomes a textual intercourse, the book at once a female body they can share and the child of their partnership. These man-made texts steal a generative power that women's bodies seem to represent. Seen as the site of a struggle between homosexual and homophobic energies, the texts Koestenbaum explores – works of psychoanalysis, sexology, fiction, and poetry – emerge as more complex, more revealing. They crystallize and refract the anxiety of male sexuality at the end of the last century, and open up a deeper understanding of connections today between the erotic and the literary. Drawing upon the work of feminist critics, Koestenbaum connects male collaboration and the exchange of women within patriarchy: he peers into both medical texts and imaginative literature, disturbing our ready acceptance of the co-authored work. This strong and unsettling book transforms our understanding of the creative process, providing a new sense of what both collaborative and solitary artistry mean.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=ikMiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781351818674"

"kPM8DAAAQBAJ","Romance Revisited","Lynne Pearce, Jackie Stacey","[]","","After decades of feminism and deconstruction, romance remains firmly in place as a central preoccupation in the lives of most women. Divorce rates skyrocket, the traditional family is challenged from all sides, and yet romance seems indestructible. In terms of its cultural representation, the popularity of romance also appears unchallenged. Popular fiction, Hollywood cinema, television soap-operas, and the media in general all display a seemingly bottomless appetite for romantic subjects. The trappings of classic romance—white weddings, love songs, Valentine's Day--are as commercially viable as ever. In this anthology of original essays, romance is revisited from a wide spectrum of perspectives, not just in fiction and film but in a whole range of cultural phenomena. Essays range over such issues as Valentine's Day, interracial relationships, medieval erotic visions and modern romance fiction, the relationship between the lesbian poet H.D. and Bryher, the pervasive whiteness of romantic desire, lesbian erotica in the age of AIDS, and the public romance of Charles and Diana.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=kPM8DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780814766316"

"kmhZDwAAQBAJ","Empire of Neglect","Christopher Taylor","[]","","Following the publication of Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, nineteenth-century liberal economic thinkers insisted that a globally hegemonic Britain would profit only by abandoning the formal empire. British West Indians across the divides of race and class understood that, far from signaling an invitation to nationalist independence, this liberal economic discourse inaugurated a policy of imperial “neglect”—a way of ignoring the ties that obligated Britain to sustain the worlds of the empire’s distant fellow subjects. In Empire of Neglect Christopher Taylor examines this neglect’s cultural and literary ramifications, tracing how nineteenth-century British West Indians reoriented their affective, cultural, and political worlds toward the Americas as a response to the liberalization of the British Empire. Analyzing a wide array of sources, from plantation correspondence, political economy treatises, and novels to newspapers, socialist programs, and memoirs, Taylor shows how the Americas came to serve as a real and figurative site at which abandoned West Indians sought to imagine and invent postliberal forms of political subjecthood.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=kmhZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780822371748"

When the chance to play for his hometown team, the Miami Thunder, comes along, he’s open to it.

"nuOqDwAAQBAJ","University Babylon","Curtis Marez","[]","","From the silent era to the present, film productions have shaped the way the public views campus life. Collaborations between universities and Hollywood entities have disseminated influential ideas of race, gender, class, and sexual difference. Even more directly, Hollywood has drawn writers, actors, and other talent from ranks of professors and students while also promoting the industry in classrooms, curricula, and film studies programs. In addition to founding film schools, university administrators have offered campuses as filming locations. In University Babylon, Curtis Marez argues that cinema has been central to the uneven incorporation and exclusion of different kinds of students, professors, and knowledge. Working together, Marez argues, film and educational institutions have produced a powerful ideology that links respectability to academic merit in order to marginalize and manage people of color. Combining concepts and methods from critical university studies, ethnic studies, native studies, and film studies, University Babylon analyzes the symbolic and institutional collaborations between Hollywood filmmakers and university administrators over the representation of students and, by extension, college life more broadly.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=nuOqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780520304581"

"p_D2DwAAQBAJ","Crisis and Legitimacy in Atlantic American Narratives of Piracy","Alexandra Ganser","[]","","This Open Access book, Crisis and Legitimacy in Atlantic American Narratives of Piracy: 1678-1865, examines literary and visual representations of piracy beginning with A.O. Exquemelin’s 1678 Buccaneers of America and ending at the onset of the US-American Civil War. Examining both canonical and understudied texts—from Puritan sermons, James Fenimore Cooper’s The Red Rover, and Herman Melville’s “Benito Cereno” to the popular cross-dressing female pirate novelette Fanny Campbell, and satirical decorated Union envelopes, this book argues that piracy acted as a trope to negotiate ideas of legitimacy in the contexts of U.S. colonialism, nationalism, and expansionism. The readings demonstrate how pirates were invoked in transatlantic literary production at times when dominant conceptions of legitimacy, built upon categorizations of race, class, and gender, had come into crisis. As popular and mobile maritime outlaw figures, it is suggested, pirates asked questions about might and right at critical moments of Atlantic history.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=p_D2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9783030436230"

Entertainment research expert Kevin Goetz, founder and CEO of Screen Engine, draws on almost four decades of experience to show how strategic decisions—from development to release—help minimize risks and maximize returns. Armed with audience insights and data-driven strategies, Goetz demonstrates how every film should make money when made and marketed for the right price. Key insights include: • Recognizing what constitutes a big idea and developing it thoughtfully to set the foundation for success. • Identifying the reason why a movie should exist and what it uniquely brings to the marketplace that will inspire interest and excitement to see it. • Crafting films with a specific audience in mind and aligning production and marketing budgets to fit the size of its potential. • Understanding how digital entertainment has reshaped audience behavior and perceptions of what makes a movie “theater-worthy.” • Elevating both the concept and execution to ensure a film stands out in a crowded and competitive marketplace. • Understand and embrace the challenges of genre-blending films, or “feathered fish,” with a clear-eyed approach, tackling complexities head-on instead of avoiding them. • Using test audience feedback to guide the film’s development all the way through postproduction, identifying danger signs along the way, and increasing the chances of success. • And much more! For industry executives, filmmakers, film students, and film enthusiasts, How to Score in Hollywood offers a unique behind-the-scenes look at the important processes that shape what consumers are offered to watch. From the initial greenlight to the final cut, Goetz explores the critical balance between creativity and commerce in filmmaking, highlighting the vital role of research at every stage to create films that resonate with audiences while also turning a profit.

Raise the dead? A clan of vampires bothering you? Do you like the really nasty werewolf erotica? The Library of the Profane has all of that, but not everyone can handle the contents (Some people can't handle their werewolf erotica). I've been a librarian here for five years and when I say I killed to get this job, I'm not being facetious. You can't check out our books. Some of the books are sentient and don't like it. We have rooms to perform the spells in or hell, we do have a copy machine (copies are extra). When a witch came in and said they needed to do a little necromancy, I didn't question it. They wouldn't have been given a library card if they were going to raise someone really bad. I helped with the necromancy because it's just my job as a librarian. Except it wasn't a normal resurrection. It was the physical embodiment of Chaos and when he woke up, he saw me first and now he's attached. Chaos personified is a horrible library guest and he won't leave with the witch who raised him. He's constantly getting into things he's not supposed to and he's really into the werewolf erotica. It's not like I can let him out because the Library of the Profane is meant to contain Chaos. The rest of the world isn't. He's awful about keeping his identity secret too. A warlock, a Hellhound, and a vampire know he's here and they are bugging me to let Chaos have a little fun. I just want a normal day of summoning demons, cursing people, and telling people to be quiet in my library.

The world saw us as the dream team, but behind the microphones, things were far messier. Our producer is determined to sideline me, the press is obsessed with our 'will-they-won't-they' dynamic, and my once-steady relationship is on its last thread. The worst part?

When she learns she will be sacrificed, Greta is forced to ally herself with Dayne, the dangerous local sorcerer, and the only person strong enough to protect her. Claimed: Charlee wakes in a strange bed without any memory of who she is. All she knows is that a man who claims to be a doctor and is there to help her, doesn’t seem to want to let her go. And maybe this is just her imagination, but does he have fangs? Mated: Jane isn’t a vampire, but their blood runs through her veins, making her a target for those who resent a human being “kindred”. When she’s given to the leader of the werewolf pack to satisfy a gambling debt, she discovers her blood has a far greater impact on her destiny than she ever could have imagined. BOOK 2: INCUBUS AWAKENED: This title was previously published as Save My Soul. All he’s asking for is her soul… After buying the historic home she’s fantasized about since childhood, Anna Worthington discovers she isn’t alone. Luc, a dangerously seductive incubus, has been trapped by a curse for the last fifty years, and Anna is willing to do almost anything to get rid of her problem house guest. All she has to do is resist him long enough to break the spell so they can go their separate ways. If she doesn’t, she could die. And that would be the best case scenario. BOOK 3: HUNTED: It started with one lost pup; it may end in a war… Panthers don’t do responsibility. They don’t do long-term relationships. They definitely don’t raise kids. But when Z discovers a young wolf in the forest, he takes him in, unaware of the powerful beings hunting the pup. Fiona is a witch who can’t leave her house; the birds have told her something bad will happen, and the birds are always right. The mailbox is as far as she’ll go, but even that may provide more danger than she’s bargained for. When a wolf pup stumbles into her garden, her safe, wrapped-up world heads for a free fall. But along with danger, the pup brings a chance at love—a chance an agoraphobic witch and a bachelor panther aren’t likely to find on their own. BOOK 4: BAD MAGIC: Immortality can be a bitch… Tamara has lived nearly two thousand years, trapped by a spell of her own creation. Hunted by her enemy and former lover, she knows there is only one man strong enough to release her from the curse. But will Cain honor her death wish, or keep her for himself, whatever the cost? Two ancient souls. Two weary fighters torn between love and hate, forced to decide if the other could be worth living for. BOOK 5: FORBIDDEN: To see him again is forbidden… Angeline knows Father Hadrian will never forgive her for their ugly history.

When he reaches his full power on his twenty-eighth birth moon, he’ll have a chance to break free to find her and finally reunite with his family. But vampires and werewolves are mortal enemies.

"v0VVEQAAQBAJ","Dashing to the End","Eric Monder","[]","","Born Alfred Reginald John Truscott-Jones, Welsh American actor Ray Milland (1907–1986) appeared in more than 135 theatrical releases between 1929 and 1985 and on radio, television, and the stage, while also becoming a film director; Milland’s extensive canon across such a period is remarkable, especially considering his lack of formal training, his belated start in show business in his late twenties, and the fact he only lived to age seventy-nine. Perhaps best remembered for his Oscar-winning performance as the tortured alcoholic in Billy Wilder’s The Lost Weekend (1945) or his outstanding collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock in Dial M for Murder (1954), there is much more to Milland’s life and career than the few films that elevated him from star to icon. Despite his prolific and successful career, Dashing to the End: The Ray Milland Story is the first comprehensive biography of the star. Milland’s personal and professional trajectory epitomize quintessential Hollywood lore: the British army soldier-turned-actor who went from unknown, struggling bit player to Oscar-winning star to aging, scandal-haunted “has-been” to comeback character actor to present-day cult figure. Using interviews with Milland’s costars and colleagues, as well as research from several major archives, author Eric Monder brings into sharp relief both the positive and negative aspects of the Hollywood film and television industries and paints a well-rounded portrait of this complex man and artist.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=v0VVEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781496856746"

"wBcGDAAAQBAJ","Baroness Orczy's The Scarlet Pimpernel","Sally Dugan","[]","","Since its publication in 1905, The Scarlet Pimpernel has experienced global success, not only as a novel but in theatrical and film adaptations. Sally Dugan charts the history of Baroness Orczy's elusive hero, from the novel's origins through its continuing afterlife, including postmodern appropriations of the myth. Drawing on archival research in Britain, the United States and Australia, her study shows for the first time how Orczy's nationalistic superhero was originally conceived as an anarchist Pole plotting against Tsarist Russia, rather than a counter-revolutionary Englishman. Dugan explores the unique blend of anarchy, myth and magic that emerged from the story's astonishing and complex beginnings and analyses the enduring elements of the legend. To his creator, the Pimpernel was not simply a swashbuckling hero but an English gentleman spreading English values among benighted savages. Dugan investigates the mystery of why this imperialist crusader has not only survived the decline of the meta-narratives surrounding his birth, but also continues to enthrall a multinational audience. Offering readers insights into the Pimpernel's appearances in print, in film and on the stage, Dugan provides a nuanced picture of the trope of the Scarlet Pimpernel and an explanation of the phenomenon's durability.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=wBcGDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781317176169"

This year, the Irish liquor kingpin is a reluctant groomsman in the most important event of my life: my best friend's wedding. As Maid of Honor, it's my duty to get Beck down the aisle.

"zo2hEAAAQBAJ","The Two Week Roommate","Roxie Noir","[""Fiction""]","","We used to be best friends. Now we’re snowed in together. There are probably worse things than being stuck in a remote cabin with the rugged-yet-grumpy forest ranger who saved my life in a blizzard. Getting mauled by a bear, for example, though I might prefer that to eating breakfast with Gideon Bell, the guy who nearly ruined my life when we were kids. It was twenty years ago. We haven’t spoken since. Our families still hate each other, and our lives are completely different. I’m not sure we’ve got anything in common besides childhood memories. But when it’s just the two of us for a couple of weeks, none of that really matters. What matters is the way Gideon grumbles, but makes my tea exactly the way I like it. What matters is how he always gives me the spot on the couch closest to the fireplace. What matters is how he looks at me when he thinks I’m not paying attention. And those childhood memories? He’s in all my favorites. Up here, in the cabin, it’s easy to look past all that because it feels so good to kiss him. It’s easy to spend a wild night in front of the fireplace and wake up still wrapped together. But back in the real world, where everything that drove us apart is still alive and kicking? It’s a lot harder. Can Gideon and I fix what broke twenty years ago, or does what happens in the cabin have to stay in the cabin? The Two Week Roommate is the second book in the Wildwood Society series, and can be read as a total standalone. It's for fans of high heat forced proximity romantic comedies, and features childhood friends-to-enemies-to-lovers who get snowed in together, a quirky, charming small town, a grumpy former military hero, a sunshine heroine who melts his heart, and plenty of steamy scenes. Of course, there's an HEA. ﻿This series is for fans of Kathyrn Nolan, Elizabeth O'Roark, Kate Canterbary, and Melanie Harlow.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=zo2hEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781957049236"

To say Mondays suck is the understatement of the century. If there's one person that can make me hate my very existence, It's Matthew Lewis III, Esquire. He's the kind of man that makes any sort of rational thought go right out the window-which is exactly what happened when I thought taking a golf club to his car was a good idea. Did I mention this was after I ripped his prissy ass to shreds and marched out with my middle fingers in the air? I'm a functioning adult, I swear. But my victory was short-lived when he shows up at my apartment with an ultimatum. Either face a felony for destroying his car or pretend for a few short months that I love him. I just hope he's ready to give me an Oscar for this performance because pretending to be head over heels for Mr. Prick-On-A-Stick without ending up with a second felony will be a miracle. But everything changes the moment his wicked tongue takes us from the boardroom to the bedroom and I'm desperately holding on to the last shred of hate I have left for him. You know how they say there's a thin line between love and hate? I think that line might have just disappeared.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=zqDwzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","9798572902181"

"zx4336PLrnkC","The Elusive Embrace","Daniel Mendelsohn","[]","","Hailed for its searing emotional insights, and for the astonishing originality with which it weaves together personal history, cultural essay, and readings of classical texts by Sophocles, Ovid, Euripides, and Sappho, The Elusive Embrace is a profound exploration of the mysteries of identity. It is also a meditation in which the author uses his own divided life to investigate the ""rich conflictedness of things,"" the double lives all of us lead. Daniel Mendelsohn recalls the deceptively quiet suburb where he grew up, torn between his mathematician father's pursuit of scientific truth and the exquisite lies spun by his Orthodox Jewish grandfather; the streets of manhattan's newest ""gay ghetto,"" where ""desire for love"" competes with ""love of desire;"" and the quiet moonlit house where a close friend's small son teaches him the meaning of fatherhood. And, finally, in a neglected Jewish cemetery, the author uncovers a family secret that reveals the universal need for storytelling, for inventing myths of the self. The book that Hilton Als calls ""equal to Whitman's 'Song of Myself,'"" The Elusive Embrace marks a dazzling literary debut.","https://books.google.com/books/content?id=zx4336PLrnkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780307809872"
